# terraform_study

This project is followed by [Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way/).

Terraform is used to automate the whole process to build the infrastructures, create a Kubernetes cluster and deploy a nginx pod into the cluster, all from scratch.

All the deployment is based on GCP.

### How to use

#### Operate locally

1. Assign your GCP credential json file in main.tf/provider "google"

2. Set up your project_id in your GCP, at variables.tf/variable "PROJECT_ID"
3. Choice your own settings like controller&worker instance type, number in variables.tf
4. Execute ```terraform plan``` in the terminal to see the details of the changes
5. Execute ```terraform apply``` in the terminal to apply all the changes
6. Destory all the infrastructures by executing ```terraform destory```

#### Trigger by Github Actions

1. Fork the repo to your own 

2. Set up a workspace in your terraform cloud account, and assign it to your GitHub repo

3. Set an Environment Variables in terraform cloud: 

   ​	GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS - save the GCP credential json file.

   ​		**Note: you may need to write the whole context into one single line**

4. Set a secret in your Github:

   ​	TF_API_TOKEN - save the credential token of your terraform cloud(generated in terraform cloud)

5. Add a Pull Request in your GitHub repo, it will trigger a ```terraform plan``` action in your terraform cloud(currently unavailable)

6. Merge a Pull Request or Push to the main branch of the repo, it will trigger a ```terraform apply``` action in your terraform cloud. If there is no error, your can conform the apply in your Terraform cloud, then all the changes will be deployed to  your GCP.
